# Widgets React - POC

Proof of concept for moving our [widgets](https://developer.api.nhs.uk/widgets) away from iframes. Hopefully we can make use of a React to create a more maintainable codebase.\
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). If the project progresses we will look to a custom webpack configuration and the possibility of using Preact to reduce bundle size for syndicators.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
